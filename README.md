# Pre-Bootcamp-Public

This is my pre-bootcamp project repository. The first upload is a nested array exercise to give an optimal coordinate for a driver to park in order to make it as easy as possible for all his customers
to find him. The exercise almost made me overthink the solution and I was imagining creating a whole grid. Where are the streets? are there obstacles? I finally came to the simple solution that there is
no true grid, just points in space. If I find the average of the x coordinates and the average of the y coordinates, I have my optimized parking spot.

This problem challenged me to simplify in order to dominate, and I want to collect such challenges and store them here to measure my progress. 

Thanks for reading!
